# Overview of the analysis
  Here there is an interesting project analyzing the prospect of surf and ice cream shops with an initial pilot in Ohau, HI. The data analysis using the SQLlite tool is looking to determine if the proposed location has the appropriate temperature, precipitation and stations that receive the imputs for these measurements.
  
  The objective of this analysis is not to make a decision or incline towards a decision, but to describe the conditions for the decision makers to determine if the location is viable for the project.

## Results

  The deliverables seek to analyze the descriptive statistical facts for the months of June and December considering the obtained data from the measurement dataframes through the stations.
  
--- The descriptive shows that the month of June shows 1700 station entries and December measured 1517 temperature entires. The mean on June was 74.94 degrees and December was 71.04; the 3.9 degree delta between summer and winter, shows that there is temperature stability that is convenient for the project.

--- Minimum and maximum temperatures have a larger distance in comparison, with more extreme lows in December but still with signiffican highs. June has a higher floor, but the max is only 2 degrees higher than December (85, 83). This results in potential colder days in December, but still enough hot days to be operative since the 75 percentile remains at 74.00.

--- On both months the standard deviation is in the range of 3, so none of them is skewed or presents an issue in the distribution, which confirms the normal spread of temperaturs around the months.

##Summary

  Even considering there is no decision to be made by the analyst, the results of the analysis confirms that temperature remains constant and appropriate for a bech surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii.
